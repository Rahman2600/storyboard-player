It has the big clock type thing, might be a tower, might be a restaurant, who knows. I just like the view. I pulled out my phone and loaded up Pokemon Go and caught some ponyta while I made my way to the pier. </p>\n<p>I got there and absorbed the sight of it all: the ships, the sun on the water, the salt smell, the activity and the happy tourists.&nbsp;It took me a little longer than expected by about half an hour but I felt like there was no rush, so I went out of my way to catch a rarer pokemon while I was in the city. But now&nbsp;I was there, in my favorite part of the state. The Golden Gate Bridge is nice and all, but nothing beats the smell of the water and the breeze and the general ambience of this pier. I spent plenty of time there and felt it was time to go do something productive, but as soon as I started standing up, I got the weirdest text from my friend who had been radio silent for days. It was only one word.</p>\n<p>“Hello??????”</p>\n<p>The way Blake and I talk is very casual and never so ominous or accusatory. The tone of this one-word text caught me so off guard, I fumbled my phone and it fell off the pier. Not into the water, thank god, but down to where people generally don’t go. I was not going to lose my phone though. I went after it. Jumped right over the barrier and dropped about 10 feet to the ground below. That’s when it hit me.</p>\n<p>No idea what it was but it hit me hard, right in the back, knocking all the air out of my lungs. I couldn’t breath for a second but whatever hit me could. It grabbed the side of my head and slammed it against the concrete wall to my left and my vision went blurry. I dropped to my knees and my attacker held me up and prevented me from curling up on the ground. I made out a figure entering my limited vision but couldn’t make out many details. Just a red hoodie, really. He pulled my face close to his and the next detail that made itself clear was the strong smell of blood near his face. He chuckled and threw me to the ground and the last thing I saw were his hands getting closer and closer to my eyes. Then I couldn’t see anything. I could still feel though, and that was the problem. I felt his fingers dig into my eye sockets. I felt the indescribable pain of having my eyes pulled out of my head. I tried to scream for help, but he put his other hand over my throat and pushed just hard enough to make breathing impossible. I would describe the sound, but with all the pain I felt, sound was muted, or muffled at least. My only working sense was the pain I was in. </p>\n<p>He loosened up on my neck for about a second and I felt hope fill my lungs. Then I felt a shoe on my neck where his hand had been. Then I felt nothing at all. </p>\n<p></p>"

I was so in my head about the look they may or may not have given me I didn’t notice where I was going until someone pushed past me and I realized i was standing still at the top of the escalator.

Their golden hoodie moved with their motions, but seemed to flow not as a normal hoodie would. Must have been made with expensive silk or something. Eventually the stranger was out of sight and at that second my friend’s voicemail message rang out through my headphones. I gathered myself and spoke into the phone. “Hey Blake, uhh, hi yeah it’s me. You have my contact saved but I have no idea what name you have me under. Last you told me I was called ‘Stooge Number 54’, so yeah 54 calling. Just call me back when you get this.

It wasn’t a grin formed by positivity or humor, though, I don’t know how, but he made sure I knew it was a grin of malice. The doors opened and the woman stepped out. Without breaking eye contact, the man stood up and shambled out of the car and grinned wider and wider at me. I followed. It felt right. </p>\n<p>After he saw me get up, his head rolled back and he cackled, loud and echoing in the empty underground. This made me chuckle. Whatever was happening, wherever he was leading me, I knew it wasn’t something that would happen above ground. It couldn’t, with the way he was walking, or attempting to walk, rather. It looked like he didn’t have full control over his legs, or maybe like he wasn’t so ready to use them. Maybe they were just asleep after being on the subway for so long? I didn’t care. I just followed him. I&nbsp;couldn't resist. His gaze, his looking into my eyes had the same effect on me as did the Piper's flute in Hamlin.&nbsp;He continued following the woman. Eventually, she turned a corner, and he got on all fours and chased her. Took off, quieter than fog. I ran to catch up and found him already over her. She was done. I couldn’t have saved her if I wanted to. The man already ripped her throat out and was starting to tear the rest of her apart. The kill was so fast and silent I didn’t know what even happened until he grabbed something from inside her and threw it at me. He looked at me and said the only thing I ever heard him say. In a raspy voice he said, “Hungry?” </p>\n<p>I dropped to my knees and picked up whatever it was he threw and sank my own teeth into it. It tasted the way scratching an itch felt, like remembering the name of a song you only heard once but loved, like the concept of satisfaction. I wanted more, I needed more. I reached down to grab something else but he lunged at my hands. It was clear this was his meal now, what he gave me was only a sample. He grabbed me by my shoulder and jerked me towards him and put his other hand on my ear. For a hand that had been covered in blood, it was unusually cold, almost icy, sending a shiver down my spine. But something else was giving me the chills. It was footsteps. The man looked over my shoulder and I turned to look, too. Someone was walking toward where we came from, walking toward the subway. The man nodded at me and shoved me backwards a little. I understood. I got up and stalked down them down. When I was close enough, I jumped onto their back and did it. I hunted down my first meal. I ate until I couldn’t anymore. I figured there was no reason to go to Denny’s now. Not that I could anyway. My hoodie was covered in blood. I thought, probably shouldn’t stay out very long looking like this and considered what to do next. </p>\n<p></p>"

I ran and saw I was too late. He had already slaughtered her. He was holding her throat in his mouth. I was in shock; he just ate...loud smacking with no worry of being caught or any regard for hiding what he was doing. He looked up and saw me. He saw my revulsion, my objection to his actions. He saw and understood I would not be dining with him today. He saw me and he screamed, it was deafening and made my knees buckle and give out. I curled on the ground covering my ears trying to block out the sound he was making. I couldn’t run. The screech was only stopped by what I can only imagine were footsteps. I couldn’t hear anything, just the ringing of the deafening noise still in my ears. I looked up and saw a familiar face ending the screaming man from the subway’s shrieks. I barely choked out one word. “Blake?”</p>\n<p>“Hey sorry I couldn’t answer your calls and texts. I was a little busy hunting this clown down. Hard to kill, but someone needs to do it. Takes a special kind of blade, like this one, here.” Blake handed me a golden switchblade. “That will do the trick. Took a lot of trial and error to figure it out, I won’t lie. So where are you headed next?” I opened my mouth but no words could come out. My hands were shaking holding the knife. “Yeah, I should’ve figured. Hey, no worries. Just meet me at my place whenever you feel able, deal? See you then.” And with that, Blake walked off in the direction I had come from. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I gathered myself and looked around. &nbsp;I had to figure out what my next course of action would be.

It looked like he didn’t have full control over his legs, or maybe like he wasn’t so ready to use them. Maybe they were just asleep after being on the subway for so long? I didn’t care. I just followed him. I&nbsp;couldn't resist. His gaze, his looking into my eyes had the same effect on me as did the Piper's flute in Hamlin.&nbsp;He continued following the woman. Eventually, she turned a corner, and he got on all fours and chased her. Took off, quieter than fog. I ran to catch up and found him already over her. She was done. I couldn’t have saved her if I wanted to. The man already ripped her throat out and was starting to tear the rest of her apart. The kill was so fast and silent I didn’t know what even happened until he grabbed something from inside her and threw it at me. He looked at me and said the only thing I ever heard him say. In a raspy voice he said, “Hungry?” </p>\n<p></p><p>I dropped to my knees and picked up whatever it was he threw and sank my own teeth into it. It tasted the way scratching an itch felt, like remembering the name of a song you only heard once but loved, like the concept of satisfaction. I wanted more, I needed more. I reached down to grab something else but he lunged at my hands. It was clear this was his meal now, what he gave me was only a sample. He grabbed me by my shoulder and jerked me towards him and put his other hand on my ear. For a hand that had been covered in blood, it was unusually cold, almost icy, sending a shiver down my spine. But something else was giving me the chills. It was footsteps. The man looked over my shoulder and I turned to look, too. Someone was walking toward where we came from, walking toward the subway. The man nodded at me and shoved me backwards a little. I understood. I got up and stalked down them down. When I was close enough, I jumped onto their back and did it. I hunted down my first meal. I ate until I couldn’t anymore. I figured there was no reason to go to Denny’s now. Not that I could anyway. My hoodie was covered in blood. I thought, probably shouldn’t stay out very long looking like this and considered what to do next.</p>\n<p></p> <p></p>\n<p></p>"

I couldn’t bear to look any more. I turned toward the man who did this and was almost equally horrified. The man who did it was not a man. Maybe he never was, or maybe he wasn’t one anymore, but whatever the case was, there was only one human killed here tonight. Blake had stabbed the creature in the side, where most people would have ribs, only the mark it left was as if he didn’t use a gold blade but rather a grenade. The surrounding skin was charred and cracked, nothing like what a normal knife would do. I didn’t give the option to touch the mangled mess a second thought, there were way too many things that could go wrong. Eventually I looked at the thing’s face. There were eyes there sure, but not eyes it had for long. They were stolen from someone at some point. It was hard to tell how I knew that, but it was a truth you could just see. I was one more observation away from throwing up so I just left. I couldn’t be alone anymore, I had to go somewhere or to someone. I followed&nbsp; Blake. </p>\n<p>I was sure I was, at least. I didn’t see anyone or hear anything, not even the subways. Until a marimba shattered the silence, making me jump out of my skin. There was a phone ringing in front of me. I could see the glow of the screen from the ground in front of me, and the glow revealed a person farther down. I couldn’t tell much from the dim light provided, but his walking style was exactly like I saw earlier. The same shambling walk, the same inhuman rhythm. There was another one. I felt for the knife Blake gave me and found it in my pocket, but this monster wasn’t walking towards me. He was headed for the stairs up and out of the subway. As he ascended, he pulled up his blood stained hood. Then he was gone. How many monsters like this were in the city? And if they don’t just stay underground, how have they continued killing like they do? My heart was racing and my mind was full of questions. The marimba ringtone focused me and gave me a way forward. I looked for the phone and any courage I had was taken from me one last time. It was Blake’s phone. The blood on the monster who got away must have been fresh. The body before me must have been Blake, or at least what was left. I grabbed the phone and looked at the caller ID. Someone with a private number was calling. I didn’t know what to do besides let it ring out. They didn’t bother to leave a voicemail. When I pressed the home button, the phone scanned my fingerprint and unlocked. I don’t remember ever setting it or ever having this phone with me at any point, though. It seemed appropriate to do some snooping, maybe find an answer. </p>\n<p></p>"

The streets were crowded. I focused my attention on whatever was directly in front of me and let the rest fade to obscurity. If there were more Vacks out here, I didn’t care. I was focused on finding myself and warning me about what was happening. At least, that was my intent. I crossed my own path before I even reached the McDonald’s, but it wasn’t me. At least, not anymore. The hoodie that version of me wore was red, seemingly stained that way. That version of me didn’t walk right, it was that same gut wrenching shamble I saw below ground. That version of me was a Vack. That me was the Vack that killed Blake. That me was staring into the building next to it. It was the McDonald’s where I was. I was looking at me looking at me. Or, no, I wasn’t looking at me. This was not a human anymore, this is a Vack, a predator, a monster. My focus on him was shifted when the marimba rang out again. Blake’s phone was getting another call, but this time, not from some random number. It showed the name “Vinn Jillette” and the picture was me, poorly photoshopped on a magician. I guess this is how Blake saved my contact. Only, I wasn’t calling anyone right now. I checked my phone and didn’t see anything. I looked up for the Vack to see if it was making any calls but it had shambled out of sight. There was only one other me that could be making a call at that moment, so i walked over to the McDonald’s to check on myself. </p>\n<p>I saw me again. Not a me like the one that turned into a Vack, but not a me that knew so much, either. The worrisome part was that me was holding a phone, my phone, to his ear. I looked at Blake’s phone, ringing, then looked at myself, calling. I couldn’t answer. What would I say? Also, I would see me answer from the McDonald’s and what would I think? I couldn’t answer. Not yet, at least. I needed more answers. I looked across the street and crossed when it was clear. If the Vack was me at any point, I knew he would probably go to the pier sooner or later.

It was lodged in my memory from my last visit and before that even. This pier was of significance in some way or another. I crossed the last road separating me from my destination and saw me again. It was no me that I had seen before though, this one was wearing a grey hoodie. I looked at my own hoodie and noticed for the first time it was glowing gold where the knife Blake gave me was. The me in the McDonald’s had a white hoodie so it couldn’t be him. Was there a fourth me? He surprised me so much I missed &nbsp;my opportunity to cross the road and heavy traffic started up again. Between cars, I saw the grey me look over the pier. A bus passed and then that me was gone. I could only assume where he went but no way was I going to follow under the pier. Not after what I saw in the subway. I waited impatiently for the light to go red again so I could cross and sprinted to the pier. </p>\n<p>A brief look around revealed no one. Or at least, no me. I was the only me I saw. I pulled out my own phone and texted myself. Maybe the Vack would see this one. </p>\n<p>“Go to the Bridge.”</p>\n<p></p>"

It was a lack of feeling. The sight of him made me devoid of any emotion and was like a vacuum to feeling. I wanted to avoid him. I hurried to the bridge.</p>\n<p></p>"

I could see people walking all around the streets, I could see faces of the people in cars, I could read their lips on the phone.
