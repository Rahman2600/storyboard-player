This is a programming course designed to get you to think declaratively and non-procedurally. If you think that changing the value of a variable is a weird thing to do both from a human's perspective (just what does a variable's value mean if it keeps changing?) and from a computer's perspective (if the value was used for something else, does that value also have to change? If something is already computed can't the old value just be retrieved? We can optimize code better if we know what it means. \"Undo\" becomes trivial.) then this course is for you.</p><p></p><p>What kind of project will you do?</p>"
